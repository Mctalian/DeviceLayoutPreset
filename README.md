# DeviceLayoutPreset

An addon for World of Warcraft to make playing on different devices a little easier.

_Do you play WoW on a PC and a laptop? Perhaps you've been playing on SteamDeck or another handheld? Are you annoyed that when you switch between these devices, the first thing you need to do is open "Edit Mode" and select the correct preset?_

**Then allow DeviceLayoutPreset to do that for you!**

Simply go to the addon's options (`/dlp`) and select the preset to load. Do this on all of your devices and you'll never have to worry about swapping between devices again!

That is seriously it! It's just about the simplest addon you could ask for.
